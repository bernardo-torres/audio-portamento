# Audio portamento using optimal transport
This repository provides a python implementation of the optimal transport based generalization of audio portamento. The implementation is based on the following paper:

- [Trevor Henderson], [Justin Solomon],
*Audio Transport: A Generalized Portamento via Optimal Transport*, ICASSP 2021.  [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06763) [[github]](https://github.com/sportdeath/audio_transport)


This code implements the the static effect, taking takes two audio files as input and combining the two using the effect to produce and output audio file. Examples of generated spectograms can be seen in `audio_test.ipynb`.
